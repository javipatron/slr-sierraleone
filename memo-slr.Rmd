# Sea Level Rise - Scarcies, Sierra Leone

In this project, we will be analyzing the impacts of sea level rise in the Scarcies region of North Sierra Leone using data from the [Digital Earth Africa program](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Coastlines_specs.html#Annual-Coastlines-Shorelines).

## **Visualize the data**

The following image is a screenshot showing the visualization of the data through the interactive map displayed below.

![](data-map.png){width="70%"}

**The map below has the following features:**

-   Area of interest in yellow.

-   Data points are represented by different colors, which indicate the shoreline behavior over time. The color determination and count per cluster can be found in [###Table 1].

-   The extent of mangroves is depicted in the color green.

-   **To navigate the map and select specific layers, you can use the interactive buttons provided.**

-   In the left-hand section, there is a "layers button" that you can use to navigate to the different data sets.

-   Removing the "World" layer helps enhance the level of detail in the satellite images provided by the tmap() function.

```{r, echo = F}

# create a new column "rate_color" with colors corresponding to the rate_time values

## Important Insights

-   Complicated coastline and model: The coastline and the model used to define shoreline distances are complex due to various environmental factors such as currents, deltas, and islands.

-   Extreme values: Values greater than 200 meters are more likely to indicate modeling issues rather than real-world coastal change.

-   Noisy data points: The dataset contains 3,920 points categorized as noisy. Additionally, in the year 2001, there are 1,398 fuzzy data points, which have been removed entirely.

-   Median values per year: Using the median values, a linear model suggests an erosion rate of 0.304 meters per year, indicating a potential loss or erosion of 30.4 centimeters annually.

-   Mean values per year: Running a linear model on the mean values indicates that for every one unit increase in year, the mean shoreline distance is projected to grow by 1.4 meters.

## Questions: 

1.  Focus on erosion data points: Should the focus be on data points that show erosion related to sea-level rise, rather than a broader shoreline analysis?

2.  Correlation with mangrove presence: Are we interested on the correlation between shoreline movement and the presence of mangroves?

3.  Winsorize function for outliers: Should the Winsorize() function be used to control outliers by setting maximum and minimum points for shoreline erosion?

  rename_with(~gsub("^dist_", "", .x), starts_with("dist_2")) %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("20"), ~if_else(. == 0, NA_real_, .))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("20"), names_to = "year", values_to = "rate_change_m") %>%
  filter(year != 2001) |> 
  select(OBJECTID, uid, rate_time, sig_time, se_time, year, rate_change_m, certainty, outl_time, geometry)


```

```{r, include = F}
# Identify the noisy points
# Convert list column to rows using unnest_tokens
noisy_points <- tidy |> 
  as.data.frame() |>  # Convert to a data frame to use unnest_tokens
  unnest_tokens(year, outl_time) |>  # Convert outl_time to rows with year

tidy_filtered <- tidy %>%
  anti_join(rows_to_remove) |>  # Remove the rows found in rows_to_remove
  dplyr::select(-outl_time, -certainty)  # Remove outl_time and certainty columns

yearly_summary <- tidy_filtered %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  select(-geometry) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(min_decile = quantile(rate_change_m, probs = 0.1),
            max_decile = quantile(rate_change_m, probs = 0.9),
            median = median(rate_change_m),
            mean = mean(rate_change_m))


yearly_summary_long <- yearly_summary |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:5,
               names_to = "stat_analysis",
               values_to = "value") |> 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

```

### Histograms

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Define a list of colors
colors <- c("skyblue", "lightgreen", "pink", "orange", "purple", "yellow", "red", "blue", "green", "brown", "gray", "violet", "cyan", "magenta", "coral", "darkgreen", "navy", "maroon", "gold", "sienna", "darkblue")


years <- c(2000:2020)

# Iterate through each year from 2000 to 2020
for (i in seq_along(years)) {
  # Subset the data for the current year
  subset_data <- tidy[tidy$year == years[i], ]
  
  # Create the histogram plot with a different color for each year
  plot <- ggplot(subset_data, aes(x = rate_change_m)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = colors[i], color = "black") +
    labs(title = paste0("Histogram - Year:", years[i])) +
    theme_bw() 
  
  print(plot)
}


```

The values represent the distance from the shoreline of each respective year to the shoreline position in 2021. Negative values indicate that the shoreline was further inland compared to 2021, suggesting shoreline growth. On the other hand, positive values indicate that the shoreline was further erosion or the movement of the shoreline further away from the reference point over time.

### OLS Model

```{r,echo = F, warning=F, message=F}

yearly_summary %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  lm(median ~ year, data = .)

yearly_summary %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  lm(mean ~ year, data = .)

```

Regarding the Median model, the slope of -0.3 implies that with a one-unit rise in the year, the Median is likely to drop by 0.3 units. This indicates that the land might lose or erode 0.304 meters. Conversely, the slope of the Mean model is 1.4, which indicates that for every one unit increase in the year, the Mean is projected to grow by 1.4.

### Annual Shoreline Change Rates

#### Webpage vs. OLS Analysis by Year

This code is comparing the `rate_time` values obtained from a webpage with those obtained from an OLS analysis for each year, to identify any differences between the two.

#### Table 2

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}

lm_test <- tidy_filtered |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  select(uid, year, rate_time, rate_change_m) |> 
  group_by(uid, rate_time) |> 
  summarize(linear = list(lm(rate_change_m ~ as.numeric(year)))) %>%
  mutate(linear_coef = map(linear, coef),
         linear_slope = map_dbl(linear_coef, 2)) |> 
  select(-c(linear, linear_coef))

kable(head(lm_test), caption = "Table 2. Comparison of the First Six Data Points ") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)


mean(lm_test$rate_time)
mean(lm_test$linear_slope)
  
```

This table and results provides a comparison between the `rate_time` variable obtained from the digital analysis and the manually computed `linear model`. In the presented table, the first 6 rows of results exhibit the `rate_time` value from Digital Africa and the `linear_slope` value calculated manually. To evaluate the model's overall fit, I computed the mean rate_time value, which equaled 0.2033 meters. Furthermore, the linear slope analysis generated a value of 0.2199, which closely aligns with the mean rate_time.
